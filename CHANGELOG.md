# 1.0.0

- Compare: [`main@7f85cc7` ‚Üí `dev@390707a`](https://github.com/mrAlexZT/passport-status-bot/compare/7f85cc7...390707a)

## Highlights
- Modularized bot architecture with centralized command registry and user management
- Playwright integration and improved HTTP handling with timeouts, proxy support, and fallbacks
- Admin UX: antiflood bypass for admins and clearer error visibility
- Dynamic versioning: latest GitHub release info for the `/version` command
- Improved QR detection and image processing
- Robust logging across scraper, middleware, and core workflows

## Added
- Enhanced scraper and Playwright logging, error handling, and timeout management
- Secure token retrieval (unwrap `SecretStr` safely)
- Admin bypass for antiflood middleware
- Safe user ID extraction and improved event handling in `LoggerMiddleware`
- Status update formatting and subscriber notifications
- Dependencies: `requests`, `types-requests`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`

## Changed
- Extensive type hints and readability improvements across modules
- Unified logging patterns and centralized messaging/text formatting
- Ruff configuration updates; use of built-in generics/`Union` syntax
- QR detection pipeline streamlined; image-processing logic refined
- Packaging: migrated `pyproject.toml` to PEP 508 style and reworked dependency layout

## Fixed
- Corrected `set_my_commands` parameter usage
- Admin commands now use `pymongo` collection retrieval consistently
- Timezone-aware datetimes across models and tests
- Async wrapper for scheduler job; tests refactored to use `AsyncMock`
- Numerous safety/robustness fixes in error logging and exception handling

## CI/CD and Tooling
- Dockerfile: Python 3.12 base; simplified Playwright install; leaner font setup
- Pre-commit and ruff updates; removed redundant hooks; clearer naming
- CI caching and workflow reorganization for faster builds
- mypy updates and config refinements (including third-party stubs)

## Docs
- Expanded `README.md` with feature set, architecture overview, and deployment notes

## Migration Notes
- Review DB indexes: `telegram_id` index removal in models may affect queries
- Ensure new dependencies are installed (`opencv-python`, `numpy`, `requests`, stubs)
- Docker consumers should rebuild with Python 3.12 base image
